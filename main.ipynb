I chose JSON instead of CSV because we are working with tests, which have commas and quotes and other symbols as well, so it would be difficult for CSV to know how to separate the columns without having conflicts with the actual contents. Also, JSON is easier to look at for humans. The downside is that it weights roughly 20 MB more and tjus it's also slightly slower to load and occupies slightly more memory when loaded.",
